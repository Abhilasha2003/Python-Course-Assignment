# Python Assignments 

This repository contains my Python assignments and practice work completed as part of my Data Analysis learning journey.  

##  About
These assignments helped me strengthen my fundamentals in:
- Functions (`print` vs `return`)
- Sets & Tuples
- Dictionary operations
- List comprehensions
- Lambda, map, filter, reduce
- Enumerate for efficient looping

## Files
- `python_assignment.ipynb` â†’ Complete Google Colab notebook with explanations and outputs.

##  Key Learnings
- Difference between `print()` and `return()`
- How to use `*args` and `**kwargs` in functions
- Practical use of list/set/dictionary comprehensions
- Applying functional programming with `lambda`, `map`, `reduce`
- Importance of `enumerate()` for clean looping
